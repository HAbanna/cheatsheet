            <li>Variable in JavaScript
<pre class="language-js"><code>var, const, let You have three different possibilities for declaring a variable in 
JavaScript, each with their own specialties: var — The most common variable.
It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with 
var move to the top when the code is executed.
const — Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.
let — Similar to const, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Data Types
<pre class="language-js"><code>Numbers — var age = 23
Variables — var x
Text (strings) — var a = "init"
Operations — var b = 1 + 2 + 3
True or false statements — var c = true
Constant numbers — const PI = 3.14
Objects — var name = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}
There are more possibilities. Note that variables are case sensitive.
That means lastname and lastName will be handled as two different variables</code></pre>
            </li>
<li>
Operators
<pre class="language-js"><code>If you have variables, you can use them to perform different kinds of operations.
To do so, you need operators.</code></pre>
</li> 
<li>
